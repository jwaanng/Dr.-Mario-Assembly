Assembly Project: Dr. Mario
Features:
- Implement gravity, so that each second that passes will automatically move the capsule down one row.
- Assuming that gravity has been implemented, have the speed of gravity increase gradually over time, or after the player completes a certain number of rows.
- Add sound effects for different conditions like rotating and dropping capsules, removing a row of squares, for beating a level and the game over condition.
- Draw Dr. Mario and the viruses on the side panels (are you proud of me, i drew this bascially one px at a time)
- Display the preview of the next capsule
- Preview of the next 4 capsules
- Play the Dr. Marioâ€™s theme music in the background while playing the game (are you proud of me pt 2, i looked at the sheet music and did this one note at a time :')))))
